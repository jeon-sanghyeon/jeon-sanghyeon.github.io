I aspire to study how media technology shapes our society and affects our minds and behaviors, researching how to design a better public sphere.

While working at a digital newsroom greatly influenced by platform logic and its curation algorithms, I found the way we produce and consume information constantly being altered by inexplicable technological forces, which was quite strange and unusual. This experience prompted me to segue into convoluted relationships and dynamics between humans and technology.

I am keen to pursue my study of how our emerging media technologies, such as AI, would shape our mental models in the form of hyper-personalized recommendations. In addition, I wish to learn what human psychological factors would respond to and would reshape those new technologies.

Another focus of my research would be unearthing how to design a wholesome media environment. By discovering facilitators to lead our mindsets into responsible, ethical media use, I want to contribute to our society's psychological well-being. I specifically hope to delve into the role of our emotions and psychological traits and investigate the power of media literacy (of all kinds) to address the potential pitfalls of our technology and society.
